- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently open for work while Iâ€™m enrolled in a Data Analytics boot camp through UNC-Charlotte. I'm doing well so far and I am expecting to earn my certificate in mid September 2023. I have several class assignments for you to view as well as extracurricular projects I am currently working on. One of which include an analysis of fictional office employee data randomly generated by Chat GPT to glean trends in production and salary. Another includes an analysis of near earth objects as classified by NASA, while another focuses on interesting perspectives of a few professional tennis players' careers since 2000.   

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning basic HTML and CSS. I am loving every step of the way! So far I am proficient in Microsoft Excel, VBA, Python (pandas, matplotlib, sqlalchemy) and SQL. 

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project involving cleaning, analysis and visualization of raw data. 

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with the next step in my career. Are you in need of a full or part time analyst? Check out my work and if I'm not what you are looking for, feel free to let me know what I can do to improve. Thanks in advance!
